Add a Topic of Interest
=======================

Intro/Why
---------
In order to have a conversation with somebody you have to tell us what you want to cover, not too sure, we recommend you start with “Professional Development – General Networking” for your first Lattitude conversation!

This is necessary so that our matching algorithm can help match you with other people and it also helps other users find you!

Step 1
------
Navigate to “Topics” tab

Step 2
------
Add a topic of interest – go ahead and start typing and it will show you the options

.. note::

    What if I don’t see a topic that fits me?

    Great question. Email support@golattitude.com and we will add it for you (soon you will be able to add your own)


.. note::

    What if I want to add more than one interest?

    Wise you are! Go ahead and click “add” again, but let’s get through this one first

Step 3
------
Choose a subtopic – this just helps us hone in on the best match for you a little bit more

Step 4
------
Choose your self-rating level (1-5), are you a (1) small leaf with little experience on the topic? Are you a (5) wise tree and perhaps a subject matter expert?

This helps us with the matching algorithm and gives you the best experience as well

.. note::
    What if I am a 5, can I still be a mentee and learn?

    Heck yes! That is what makes Lattitude so cool, we never stop learning and we always pay it forward, no matter how successful we become.

Step 5
------
Type in the years of experience you have on this topic. It is not a competition, this just helps other users understand more about you before the conversation starts

Step 6
------
Tell us why it’s a topic of interest to you (think of this as micro level overview where your bio is the macro detail)

Some users will add details such as:

- Looking to learn about career opportunities in this field and just need some help getting started and pointed in the right direction
- I want to change jobs and this industry/topic seems appealing to me and I am looking to hear about the experiences from others
- I am looking to hire this position (job req URL) and would love to talk with potential applicants to share more information – informational interviews also welcome
- This is my hobby and I love talking about this topic with likeminded people (make sure you don’t forget that it’s not all just about work!)
