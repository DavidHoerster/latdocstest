Why Lattitude
-------------
Welcome to Lattitude and thanks for joining us! Don’t worry – this will not take a long time to get up and running. This video will walk you through the first steps of getting up and running on Lattitude in LESS THAN 5 MINUTES!

Step 1 (Intro Email)
--------------------
You received an email from your admin letting you know that a Lattitude invitation will be coming your way soon (check your inbox and spam folder too)

Step 2 (Create Password)
------------------------
Click on the “password setup/reset” link in that invitation email and set your password.

Step 3 (Add Topics)
-------------------
Now you are in! Add a few topics of interest. Tell your private community what you want to Lattitude about (to learn from others and also to teach).

Step 4 (Calendar and Availability)
----------------------------------
Integrate your calendar. Lattitude works with Google and Outlook calendars today – don’t worry…nobody else will see your calendar events. Add some recurring availability – this is your office hours so others in your group can connect with you.

Step 5 (Profile Details)
------------------------
Update your profile (top right corner). Add your bio, profile pic, tell us where you work/worked, and add your education background too.

Let’s Lattitude!
