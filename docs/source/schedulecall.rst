How to Schedule a Conversation
==============================

Intro/Why
---------
Let’s schedule a conversation on Lattitude. You can do this as a mentor or a mentee and the cool part is that you do not need to remember any names – that’s where we help out!

This is how you use the tool! Either you schedule a conversation with somebody else or they will schedule a conversation with you based on your availability

Step 1
------
Navigate to “My Network” tab

Step 2
------
Type in the topic you want to discuss and click search

You can also add more filters into your search – if you are looking for a mentor, we recommend that you search for 4’s and 5’s on the topic of interest

Step 3
------
Click “Search”

Step 4
------
Check out the details of each of the other Lattitude members in your group and see why each this is a topic of interest for them

Go ahead and expand to see their bio if you want some more information

If there is more than one person in the search, scroll down and check out the other names/matches

Step 5
------
Click on availability

A new screen will pop up and you will be able to schedule a conversation by clicking on one of the time slots they are available

If they have no time slots available you can “request additional time” and this will

Send them an email and reminder to add some time so the two of you can Lattitude

Step 6 (background action)
--------------------------
Both you and the other user will receive a calendar invitation so this time slot is blocked off on your personal calendar

You will both receive an email notification informing you that the conversation has been scheduled (you will be able to update your preferences in your profile)

Your conversations tab will be updated now that this conversation has been scheduled and you will be able to add some call details (agenda, actions, notes) before the call starts

Step 7 (bonus – join the call on Lattitude)
-------------------------------------------
When it is time to join the conversation you can do that right from the home dashboard or in the conversations tab “join call”

Feel free to join up to 5 minutes before the call starts
